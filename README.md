# SoundLED

Sound-Responsive LEDs controlled by an Arduino. Built in C++ with the use of the [FastLED library](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)

There are two main ways to create sound-responsive LEDs. These are:
* Control the lights directly from your sound-source
* Control the lights with an external platform capable of interpretting the music by measuring the voltage levels

Because sound-responsive LEDs are often expensive, SoundLED aims to simplify the second option.

SoundLED as of now is only operational on the Arduino boards.
