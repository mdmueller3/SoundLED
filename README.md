# How to Download
First, you must download the FastLED library (https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
This is incredibly important! The FastLED library is a powerful but easy-to-use library that allows you to control LED lights with a wide-variety of micro controllers. 

Next, drag the FastLED library to where ever you are storing your Arduino files. For example, I keep my Arduino files in my Documents folder. So my path looks something like this: /Documents/Arduino/libraries/FastLED
