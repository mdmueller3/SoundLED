# SoundLED

Sound-Responsive LEDs controlled by an Arduino. Takes the difficulty out of programming LEDs so you can enjoy the light show!

There are two main ways to create sound-responsive LEDs. These are:
* Control the lights directly from your sound-source
* Control the lights with an external platform capable of "hearing" the music

While the first one would be nice to have, most of us don't have a sound-source capable of controlling LED lights. And while there are devices that both have GPIO pins and a chip capable of playing music, you are quickly adding complexity. So SoundLED aims to make the second one easy.

SoundLED as of now is only operational on the Arduino. Most Arduino boards should work (a full list will come soon)
